## Question 1
``` 1
{{ Guest additions are device drivers and system applications to virtualbox that allow for increased performance and more features. Guest additions are designed to be installed inside a virtual machine after a new OS is installed. One of the immediately noticeable differences is that there is mouse pointer integration, which allows me to use my mouse on both my local machine and on the vm without having to press the host key. There is also better support for shared folders now, which allow the VM to access files on the local machine more easily.}}

## Question 2
``` 2
{{ I believe my own computing experience so far aligns more closely with the windows culture Spolsky describes in "Biculturalism". According to Spolsky, the biggest difference between Unix culture and Windows culture is that Unix culture can be thought of as "programming for programmers", while Windows culture is more closely associated with "programming for non-programmers". In the EECS department, most of our programs are written for pedagogical purposes, which means that they align more closely with the Windows culture of having output for users to interact with. More specifically, my internship experience as both a product management intern and as a technology consulting intern involved situations in which programs had to be written with the end user in mind more than other developers. As an aspiring PM, it's important for me to understand that some developers may prefer to operate in a manner that aligns more closely with Unix culture. However, PMs are fundamentally the managerial glue that holds projects together with end users in mind, so it makes sense that my own opinion on the best culture would align more closely with the "user-focused" Windows culture Spolsky discusses. }}

## Question 3

{{ My biggest takeaway from Professor Guo's article on "command-line bullshittery" is that I agree with his view that the frustrating up front cost of setting up tools and environments can often obstruct progress on the intrinsic complexity of a project. I also agree that there is an important distinction between incidental versus intrinsic complexity, and I applaud him for trying to eliminate the incidental complexities for his research students. With that being said, I think Professor Guo's views align more closely with the "Windows Culture" that Spolsky discussed in his article. The end user is critical to consider when developing software, and sometimes there is a lot of command-line setup that is obscure and frustrating. On the other hand, I also believe that Eytan Adar brings up some important points in his rebuttal to Professor Guo's piece. In particular, I find his points about the need to develop meta-cognitive skills to be very compelling, because the reality is that those are the types of transferrable skills that are valuable at the cutting edge of new technology development (where there is no guide on how to do things already). My biggest comment on both articles is that it seems to me that the disagreement on the value of "command-line bullshittery" is a matter of who is going through the struggle. I think both researchers would agree that future academics and researchers should have to struggle through the bullshit in order to learn the systems rigorously, so maybe Adar's points are most applicable to aspiring researchers. I believe there is value in making software accessible to wider audiences, and for these people, who may not need the ability to debug installations or a rigorous understanding of the inner workings of the operating systems they see as black box tools, it's acceptable to complain about how frustrating command-line bullshit can be. }}
