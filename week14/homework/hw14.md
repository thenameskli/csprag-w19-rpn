## Question 2
``` 2
Yes
```

## Question 3
``` 3
The compiler may optimize the assembly differently if it knows that the code is just going to repeat noops
```

## Question 4
``` 4
cppcheck catches neither the first nor last bug
```

## Question 5
``` 5
scan-build found the last bug (valgrind-debug branch),
but did not find the first bug (gdb-debug-1 branch)
```

## Question 6
``` 6
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string message = "message";
    std::cout << message ;
    return 0;
}

```

## Question 7
``` 7
It does not impact the correctness of my program. I did not have any code that produced warnings (so I wrote a small program that generates a message for #6).
